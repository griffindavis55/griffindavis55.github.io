                <h2>Griffin Davis</h2>
                <p> Currently I am a second year software engineering student, in the co-op stream, at the University of Guelph. I am expected
                    to graduate in 2025 with a Bachelor of Computing, alongside minors in business and economics. Over the course
                    of the first two years of my degree, I have been able to expand on valuable skills such as leadership and project management.
                    I have learned to collaborate using several design methods such as agile, waterfall and test driven design.
                    The design and implementation of software has been a focal point of many of the preivous tasks which I have taken part in throughout my
                    degree, thusfar. I pride myself in being a natural leader in many aspects of my life, and this is a tranferrable quality that is an asset to any
                    organization. Additionally, I am a quick learner and adapt very easily to new environments which was especially demonstrated as
                    COVID-19 forced many changes upon . I consistently push myself to do 
                    better in all aspects of life and this is certaintly seen in workplace environements.

                <p><br>Over the past two years, I have worked consistently in the c language througout various courses. From the beginning of my degree, this has been 
                the primary language I have used and I have become quite confident in multiple libraries including math.h, time.h and other standard libraries. 
                During my second year, I dealt with many common data types, such as binary trees and **more data types**. C was also the language I used to create a large class project.
                This project included an intake of data points, which represented vectors, and modified these points with many common transformation seen on a 3D shape. This project can be accessed <a href = "https://github.com/griffindavis55/3250-class-project">here.</a> </p>
